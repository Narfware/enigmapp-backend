# EnigmApp

EnigmApp is a real-time messaging application with true end-to-end encryption (E2EE) and a privacy-by-design approach.
Users are identified by a locally generated UUID and associated public key, without the need for passwords or personal data.
Authentication is handled through nonce-based signature verification, and messaging is powered by secure WebSocket rooms.
